# tambolatracker

##Task
Build An android application that tracks the transaction on a ticket by performing CRUD operation on the data.

##Functionality
This app loads in all the list of players as provided by the user. It also features the functionality to add, update and delete an player prior to the game. From there once the players are confirmed, we proceed to the actual main tracker screen where the task transaction are performed on the ticket. I chose to build it in **Java** and use **SQLite** for the database. The tracker screen has the provision to track the updates parallely using multiple RecyclerView.
